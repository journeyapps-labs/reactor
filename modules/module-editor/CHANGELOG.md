# @journeyapps-labs/reactor-mod-editor

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 53bb55b: Expanded built-in theming and completed major editor/core migration off deprecated systems.
  - Added a new built-in core theme: `Bunny` (purple-forward), including registration, module wiring, and exports.
  - Refined core dark-theme polish for `Reactor` and `JourneyApps` to improve surface hierarchy, readability, card/table integration, and accent consistency.
  - Continued `Reactor Light` comfort pass with better separator clarity, softened contrast, and improved metadata/tag readability.
  - Tuned card metadata/tag chip styling to be more theme-aware and less visually harsh across light/dark themes.
  - Made card selection emphasis theme-specific across built-ins so selected states follow each theme accent language (for example Scarlet red, Journey orange, Bunny purple) instead of a shared blue treatment.
  - Improved selected tree-row background consistency across built-in themes, including Reactor-specific behavior where selection fill should remain subtle/neutral.
  - Refined panel/search icon contrast in light mode (including search-history affordances and tray glyph balance) for clearer visibility without reintroducing harsh saturation.
  - Polished status-card presentation in Reactor-family themes with better surface/background pairing and clearer border separation.
  - Improved table row striping behavior so even/odd row backgrounds are consistently rendered and easier to scan.
  - Reduced divider/separator intensity on key cards and settings surfaces so section boundaries read clearly without overpowering content.
  - Added safer theme-fragment resolution fallback logic to avoid hard runtime failures when a fragment lacks a requested theme key.
  - Added editor theme coupling for `Bunny` and guarded editor theme sync paths to avoid undefined selection/serialization regressions.
  - Updated action retrieval helpers in editor/demo/core touchpoints to use `ActionStore` directly.

  Breaking/migration notes:
  - Replaced editor theme provider workflow with entity-definition workflow (`EditorThemeEntityDefinition`) and migrated editor theme selection setting from `ProviderControl` to `EntitySetting`.
  - Removed legacy `EditorThemeProvider` usage and registration in editor module bootstrap.

- a96420d: Modernized core entity/action internals and removed deprecated provider + legacy DnD surfaces.
  - Added and expanded entity card presentation support, including richer describer-driven metadata rendering (`tags`, structured `labels`, and icon usage in cards).
  - Extended the describer API surface:
    - `EntityDescription.tags?: string[]` for lightweight chip-style classification.
    - `EntityDescription.labels?: EntityLabel[]` for structured key/value metadata rendering.
    - `EntityLabel` metadata now supports visual semantics (`color`, `colorForeground`, `tooltip`, `active`) and inline icon descriptors (`name`, `color`, `spin`).
  - Improved tree/card presenter UX parity with clearer empty states and search-result handling for entity collections.
  - Refined searchable tree result plumbing to report concrete matched entities, improving determinism and simplifying no-result checks.
  - Fixed searchable tree highlight lifecycle regressions (including nested tree/card contexts) to prevent initial match flicker/flash-out in active searches.
  - Stabilized tree collection rendering updates to avoid unnecessary node regeneration during search-driven rerenders.
  - Corrected deferred-force-update behavior used by tree widgets to prevent duplicate immediate+deferred update paths.
  - Refactored `EntityDefinition` to use explicit component banks per concern instead of a single mixed component collection.
  - Added reusable bank abstractions (`ComponentBank`, `PreferredSetBank`) and extracted concern-specific banks (`EntityEncoderBank`, `EntitySearchBank`).
  - Improved preferred describer preference behavior using `SetSetting`-backed controls and cleaner per-definition setting integration.
  - Reduced bank API indirection by standardizing on `getItems()`/`getPreferred()` usage.
  - Improved Reactor initialization ordering to reduce startup races across workspace, prefs, and UX store setup.
  - Fixed input-dialog initial value propagation so provided defaults are shown correctly.
  - Fixed `ArrayInput` initialization so initial values render immediately (without needing extra user interaction).
  - Improved dialog module imports to avoid root barrel coupling in dialog widget internals.
  - Fixed card presenter overflow/bleed issues so nested tree content is clipped correctly within card bounds.
  - Improved metadata/tag readability in card presenter output:
    - metadata icon colors now follow theme-aware foreground defaults more consistently.
    - tag chip styling was tuned to be less harsh while preserving contrast and readability.
  - Refined built-in theme card borders across Reactor/Scarlet/Oxide/Journey and improved Reactor Light hierarchy/contrast balance for clearer panel/tray/header boundaries.
  - Overhauled the Reactor Light theme palette to be easier on the eyes while improving structural clarity (surfaces, separators, metadata readability, and card/tag presentation).
  - Fixed a tree-search clear regression where stale text matches could persist until hover, by ensuring tree leaf/node widgets perform a post-listener-registration refresh.

  Breaking/migration notes:
  - Removed deprecated provider-based flows from core/editor paths and migrated key selections to entity definitions (`Workspace`, `EditorTheme`).
  - `System` is no longer the action access surface in active code paths; action lookup/registration now goes through `ActionStore`.
  - Migrated remaining legacy drag/drop integrations in active widget paths to `dnd3` hooks (`useDraggableEntity` / `useDraggableRaw`), and removed old `dnd`/`dnd2` usage from migrated surfaces.
  - Updated built-in and demo/editor module wiring to register and resolve actions through `ActionStore` instead of legacy `System` action helpers.
