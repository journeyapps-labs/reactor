Improve entity tree presenter grouping and panel/list UX behavior.

- Add configurable tree grouping controls for entity presenters (`none`, `label2`, `tags`) and apply grouped tree rendering when selected.
- Improve grouped tree readability by suppressing redundant secondary labels when grouping by secondary label.
- Simplify panel category handling and align media panel categorization with core panels.
- Improve secondary-label readability in built-in themes and align tree demo scrolling with Reactor scrollbar styling.
