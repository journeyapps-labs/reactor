# Intro

Note:// These docs are still a work in progress.

To get an understanding of how Reactor makes it easy to build complex apps quickly, we suggest taking a look at:
`demo/module-todos` for the Todo entity system and `demo/module-playground` for the UI playground workspace.

2. `pnpm install` (you may need to install pnpm via a tool such as homebrew)
3. `pnpm build`
4. `cd ./demo/server`
5. `pnpm watch`
