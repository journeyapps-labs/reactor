Reactor is now Open Source!

Many years back when we started working on the successor to the JourneyApps editor (now called OXIDE), we set
a goal for ourselves of building a great IDE framework first that could power the next generation of online development environments.

While this repo is still going through construction as we begin to OSS the Reactor core, the packages and demo folder
are fully operational and represent the same code that powers the cloud versions of OXIDE and the PowerSync Dashboard.
